## Description

This Homebridge plugin exposes ZigBee devices connected to TI's [CC253X](http://www.ti.com/wireless-connectivity/simplelink-solutions/zigbee/products.html) wireless SoC to Apple's HomeKit.
It uses [zigbee-herdsman](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman) and [zigbee-herdsman-converters](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters) under the hood, so technically all supported devices mapped in zigbee-herdsman-converters should be supported.
To enable a new device you must implement a new HomeKit Device class and regirster it.

This project has been heavily inspired by [homebridge-zigbee](https://github.com/itsmepetrov/homebridge-zigbee) plugin by Anton Petrov.

## Supported devices
